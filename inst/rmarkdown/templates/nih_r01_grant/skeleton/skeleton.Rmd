Project Summary / Abstract {.unnumbered}
=============================

This NIH R01 template is based on Bill Noble's previous [template](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/latexR01/).


The Project Summary must contain a summary of the proposed activity suitable for
dissemination to the public. It should be a self-contained description of the
project and should contain a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.
It should be informative to other persons working in the same or related fields
and insofar as possible understandable to a scientifically or technically
literate lay reader.  The Project Summary is meant to serve as a succinct and
accurate description of the proposed work when separated from the application.
State the application's broad, long-term objectives and specific aims, making
reference to the health relatedness of the project (i.e., relevance to the
mission of the agency). Describe concisely the research design and methods for
achieving the stated goals. This section should be informative to other persons
working in the same or related fields and insofar as possible understandable to
a scientifically or technically literate reader. Avoid describing past
accomplishments and the use of the first person. Finally, please make every
effort to be succinct. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text.

Project narrative {.unnumbered}
=============================

Using no more than two or three sentences, describe the relevance of this
research to public health. In this section, be succinct and use plain language
that can be understood by a general, lay audience.

\clearpage

Specific Aims
==============================

State concisely the goals of the proposed research and summarize the expected
outcome(s), including the impact that the results of the proposed research will
exert on the research field(s) involved.  List succinctly the specific
objectives of the research proposed, e.g., to test a stated hypothesis, create a
novel design, solve a specific problem, challenge an existing paradigm or
clinical practice, address a critical barrier to progress in the field, or
develop new technology.

\clearpage

Research strategy
===============================

Organize the Research Strategy in the specified order and using the instructions
provided below. Start each section with the appropriate section
heading---Significance, Innovation, Approach. Cite published experimental
details in the Research Strategy section and provide the full reference in the 
Bibliography and References cited section.

Significance
-------------------------------

Explain the importance of the problem or critical barrier to progress in the
field that the proposed project addresses.  Explain how the proposed project
will improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical 
practice in one or more broad fields.  Describe how the concepts, methods,
technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive
this field will be changed if the proposed aims are achieved.

Review criteria: Does the project address an important problem or a critical
barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how
will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be
improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, 
methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that
drive this field?

Innovation
--------------------------------

Instructions: Explain how the application challenges and seeks to shift current
research or clinical practice paradigms. Describe any novel theoretical
concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation or intervention(s) to be
developed or used, and any advantage over existing methodologies, 
instrumentation or intervention(s).  Explain any refinements, improvements, or
new applications of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies,
instrumentation or interventions.

Review criteria: Does the application challenge and seek to shift current
research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts,
approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the
concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel
to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, 
improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or
methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?

Approach
----------------------------------

Instructions: Describe the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses to be
used to accomplish the specific aims of the project. Unless addressed separately
in Item 5.5.15, include how the data will be collected, analyzed, and
interpreted as well as any resource sharing plans as appropriate.  Discuss 
potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success
anticipated to achieve the aims.  If the project is in the early stages of
development, describe any strategy to establish feasibility, and address the
management of any high risk aspects of the proposed work.}

For new applications, include information on Preliminary Studies as part of the
Approach section. Discuss the PD/PI'ï½ªs preliminary studies, data, and/or
experience pertinent to this application. Except for Exploratory/Development
Grants (R21/R33), Small Research Grants (R03), Academic Research Enhancement
Award (AREA) Grants (R15), and Phase I Small Business Research Grants (R41/R43),
preliminary data can be an essential part of a research grant application and
help to establish the likelihood of success of the proposed project.

Review criteria: Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses
well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project?
Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success
presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the
strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed?

Biblography
====================================

Provide a bibliography of any references cited in the Research Plan. Each
reference must include names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they
appear in the publication), the article and journal title, book title, volume
number, page numbers, and year of publication. Include only bibliographic 
citations. Follow scholarly practices in providing citations for source
materials relied upon in preparing any section of the application.  The
references should be limited to relevant and current literature. While there is
not a page limitation, it is important to be concise and to select only those
literature references pertinent to the proposed research.}

When citing articles that fall under the Public Access Policy,
were authored or co- authored by the applicant and arose from NIH support,
provide the NIH Manuscript Submission reference number (e.g., NIHMS97531) or the
PubMed Central (PMC) reference number (e.g., PMCID234567) for each article. If
the PMCID is not yet available because the Journal submits articles directly to
PMC on behalf of their authors, indicate ``PMC Journal - In Process.'' Citations
that are not covered by the Public Access Policy, but are publicly available in
a free, online format may include URLs or PMCID numbers along with the full
reference (note that copies of these publications are not accepted as appendix
material, see Section 5.7).

Resources {.unnumbered}
====================================

Instructions: This information is used to assess the capability of the
organizational resources available to perform the effort proposed.  Identify the
facilities to be used (laboratory, clinical, animal, computer, office, other).
If appropriate, indicate their capacities, pertinent capabilities, relative
proximity and extent of availability to the project. Describe only those
resources that are directly applicable to the proposed work. Provide any
information describing the Other Resources available to the project (e.g., 
machine shop, electronic shop) and the extent to which they would be available
to the project.  Describe how the scientific environment in which the research
will be done contributes to the probability of success (e.g., institutional
support, physical resources, and intellectual rapport). In describing the
scientific environment in which the work will be done, discuss ways in which the
proposed studies will benefit from unique features of the scientific environment
or subject populations or will employ useful collaborative arrangements.}

Review criteria: Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done
contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support,
equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate
for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the
scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements?
