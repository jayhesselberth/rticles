In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and
$Z_2$. In addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the 
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in studies of
escape dynamics. We will first consider the expected resistant population at
$vT_x$ for some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)

$$
E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
\biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].
$$

If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay 
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as 
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically estimate the
expected value as

<!-- 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
\frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
\end{eqnarray}
$$
-->

Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see @{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
